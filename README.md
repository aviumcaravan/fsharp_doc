Welcome to the F# tutorial created by me! While the language might seem to be difficult, once you get past the basics, you'll come to realise that it's not all that difficult. First of all, it's really similar to C# and Visual Basic .NET, so if you're familiar with either of these, F# won't be much of a challenge.

## Things you'll need

Of course, you'll need some things. It's recommended that you clean up your drive a bit, since you'll need to install the following things:
	* Visual Studio 201x (2017/19 are recommended);
	* dotNET desktop development kit;
	* Following components (**Individual components** section):
		* latest .NET Core version from the list;
		* .NET Framework kits v 4.5.x and later;
		* .NET Native;
		* Advanced ASP.NET features;
		* .NET Compiler Platform SDK
